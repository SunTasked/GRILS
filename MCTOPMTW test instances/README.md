This directory contains every test file used by Wouter J Souffriau to test his implementation of the GRILS algorithm.

The "Test_script.py" file allows you to automatically test every file contained in the "MCTOPMTW-Cordeau" and "MCTOPMTW-Cordeau" directories.
Each file will be tested 10 times so you might want to grab some popcorns and log into your netflix account while it runs.
The script execution time might take up to 8hours...
The results of each file will be happenned to Results.csv.
